Feature: Inventory Management System Alerts and Operations

  Background:
    Given the inventory management system is set up with initial configurations

  @stock_alert
  Scenario: Verify stock level alerts
    Given stock levels are set for various items
    When the user reduces the stock level of an item below the specified threshold
    Then the system should automatically alert the user about the low stock level

  @auto_reorder
  Scenario: Verify automatic reordering of supplies
    Given stock levels are below reorder threshold
    When the system checks stock levels
    Then it should automatically place an order for items below the reorder threshold

  @mobile_compatibility
  Scenario: Verify mobile compatibility and accessibility
    Given a user has a mobile device with the app installed
    When the user accesses the inventory management application on a mobile device
    Then the application should load and display correctly on the mobile device

  @access_prevention
  Scenario: Verify unauthorized access prevention
    Given user roles are defined in the system
    When a user attempts to access the system with a role that has no permissions
    Then the system should deny access and display an unauthorized access message

  @data_integrity
  Scenario: Verify data integrity on network failure
    Given network connectivity is unstable
    When the user performs inventory updates and then simulates a network failure
    Then the system should ensure no data loss and data should be consistent once the network is restored

Feature: Inventory Management System Negative Scenarios

  @alert_failure
  Scenario: Verify alert failure on incorrect threshold
    Given an incorrect stock threshold is set
    When the user reduces the stock level of an item below the incorrect threshold
    Then the system should not alert the user, identifying a setup issue in threshold configuration

  @reorder_failure
  Scenario: Verify failure in reordering without vendor details
    Given no vendor details are provided for an item
    When the stock of an item falls below the reorder threshold
    Then the system should fail to place an order and notify the user of missing vendor details

  @mobile_incompatibility
  Scenario: Verify mobile incompatibility on outdated OS
    Given a mobile device has an outdated OS
    When the user attempts to run the application on this device
    Then the application should not install or should display compatibility issues

  @data_corruption
  Scenario: Verify data corruption on abrupt app closure
    Given a user is updating inventory data
    When the user abruptly closes the app during data update
    Then the system should either rollback the incomplete transaction or prompt data corruption warning

  @unauthorized_api_access
  Scenario: Verify unauthorized data access through API
    Given API endpoints are exposed
    When a user accesses the API with unauthorized credentials
    Then the system should block access and log the unauthorized attempt
