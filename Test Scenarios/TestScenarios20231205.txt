Feature: Inventory Management System Alerts and Actions

  Background:
    Given the inventory management system is set up with initial configurations

  @alert
  Scenario: Verify automatic alert on low stock
    Given inventory items are already added in the system
    When the user reduces the stock of an item below the specified threshold
    Then the system should automatically alert the user that the stock level is low

  @reorder
  Scenario: Verify automatic reordering of supplies
    Given stock levels are set and supplier details exist
    When the user allows stock of an item to fall below reorder level
    Then the system should automatically place an order with the supplier for replenishment

  @mobile
  Scenario: Verify mobile compatibility and accessibility
    Given the user has a mobile device with internet access
    When the user accesses the inventory management application on a mobile device
    Then the application should load and display correctly on the mobile device

  @security
  Scenario: Verify security measures for unauthorized access
    Given user profiles are set with varying permissions
    When the user attempts to access the application with an unauthorized user profile
    Then the system should deny access and log the unauthorized attempt

  @update
  Scenario: Verify update of inventory information on mobile
    Given the user is logged in on a mobile device
    When the user updates the stock level of an item using the mobile application
    Then the stock level should be updated successfully and reflect immediately in the system

  @negative
  Scenario: Negative Test: Exceed stock capacity

    When the user attempts to add stock beyond the maximum capacity limit
    Then the system should prevent adding stock and display an error message about exceeding capacity

  @invalid
  Scenario: Negative Test: Invalid supplier details

  @edge
  Scenario Outline: Edge Case Scenarios
    Given <Pre-Condition>
