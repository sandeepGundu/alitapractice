| TC01         | Verify stock level alerts                       | Inventory items and thresholds set    | 1. Reduce the stock of an item below its specified threshold.              | 1. The system should trigger an alert indicating that the stock level is below the threshold.           |
|              |                                                 |                                       | 2. Check the alert notification area.                                      | 2. The alert for low stock should be visible in the notification area.                                 |
| TC02         | Verify automatic reordering of supplies         | Stock levels and reorder settings set | 1. Allow an item's stock to fall below the reorder threshold.              | 1. The system should automatically place an order for the required quantity of the item.               |
|              |                                                 |                                       | 2. Check the order status in the system.                                   | 2. The order status should be updated to "Ordered" or a similar status indicating a successful order.  |
| TC03         | Test mobile compatibility for updating inventory | Mobile app installed and logged in    | 1. Update the stock level of an item using the mobile application.         | 1. The stock level should be successfully updated and reflect the new quantity in the system.          |
| TC04         | Verify security - unauthorized access attempt   | User not logged in                    | 1. Attempt to access inventory data without logging in.                    | 1. Access should be denied, and the user should be prompted to log in.                                 |
| TC05         | Verify robustness of data during high traffic   | Multiple users logged in              | 1. Simultaneously update inventory data by multiple users.                 | 1. All updates should be processed correctly without data loss or corruption.                         |
| TC06         | Negative Test: Exceed stock update limits       | Valid user logged in                  | 1. Attempt to increase stock level of an item beyond its maximum capacity. | 1. The system should display an error message indicating that the stock level cannot exceed the limit. |
| TC07         | Negative Test: Invalid reorder threshold        | Valid user logged in                  | 1. Set a reorder threshold higher than the maximum stock capacity.         | 1. The system should display an error message indicating an invalid threshold setting.                |
| TC08         | Edge Case: Zero threshold setting               | Valid user logged in                  | 1. Set the reorder threshold of an item to zero.                           | 1. The system should either accept zero as a valid threshold or display an error if it's not allowed.  |
| TC09         | Edge Case: Simultaneous access and update       | Multiple users logged in              | 1. Have two users update the same item's stock at the exact same time.     | 1. The system should correctly process both updates without overwriting or errors.                    |
