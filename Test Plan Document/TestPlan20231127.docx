- Legacy systems that are out of the scope of the current version.

#### 5. Approach
- **Functional Testing** to ensure all features work according to the requirements.
- **Usability Testing** to ensure the application is intuitive and easy to use.
- **Performance Testing** to ensure the application performs well under expected loads.
- **Security Testing** to ensure the application is secure from external threats.
- **Regression Testing** to ensure new changes do not affect existing functionalities.

#### 6. Item Pass/Fail Criteria
- A feature is considered PASS if it functions as expected and meets the requirements specified.
- A feature is considered FAIL if it does not function as expected or deviates from specified requirements.

#### 7. Suspension Criteria and Resumption Requirements
- Testing will be suspended if the application fails to complete any critical process, e.g., checkout or payment.
- Testing will resume once the issues are resolved and verified by the development team.

#### 8. Test Deliverables
- Test Plan document.
- Test Cases and Test Scripts.
- Test Reports, including defect reports and performance reports.
- Final Test Summary Report.

#### 9. Testing Tasks
- Identify and prepare test cases based on the requirements.
- Set up the testing environment.
- Execute test cases.
- Record the results and report defects.
- Retest the fixed defects.
- Prepare final test reports.

#### 10. Environmental Needs
- Testing will be conducted in both staging and production-like environments.
- Required hardware includes desktops and mobile devices for testing responsiveness and compatibility.
- Required software includes browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and database management tools.

#### 11. Responsibilities
